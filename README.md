This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I've been a tech writer for about 15 years, on and off. In the 90s, I worked as an AutoCAD programmer for an HVAC company in Arizona, helping them automate their CAD design/drafting procedures. In 2000, I worked at Autodesk in Developer Technical Services, supporting 3rd party AutoCAD developers. For the last 10 years, I've worked with Siemens EDA (formerly Mentor Graphics) as a senior tech writer, creating COM API docs for some of their CAD tools.
